        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            I am an online game developer. And I have loved games since I was a kid. I think no one can leave the
            game. A
            world without games is boring. Games can draw the distance between people. The games on the market are
            starting to move away from this core value. I want to create a game that can draw the distance between
            people again.

                <h1>Work experience</h1>
                <p>
                    I worked for a tech company as an assisting project manager for two years. In my daliy work, i need
                    to
                    plan
                    the development schedule with developer and communicate with client for projects. In that two years,
                    I
                    found
                    my interest in coding.</p>
                <p>
                    My brother is developer with
                    coding
                    experience over 10 years. He is also a founder of another tech company.
                    He teached me the basic coding concepts. And i learn C++ on youtube myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And I want to know where am I now? It seems that its a time to get a cert from school to verify my
                    coding ability and learn what have I missed. But i don't have too much time to do it. So I think
                    bootcamp would be my best choice.

                        I love table tennis. Table tennis requires a nervous response. Through this exercise, I can keep
                        a clear mind. I can think quickly when I encounter problems.
